# ROAMeR Simulation

<!-- TODO: Improve summary when funcitonality is more mature -->
Robot simulation package for ROAMeR providing Gazebo simulation.

## Usage

<!-- TODO -->

## Development Constraints

This package depends on the base URDF macro(s) in `roamr_description` through their extension to
Gazebo. This package may also come to depend upon actuation and sensing configurations that match
the physical robot design.
